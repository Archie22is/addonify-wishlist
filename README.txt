== Description ==

Addonify WooCommerce Wishlist is a powerful toolkit which adds a wishlist functionality to your e-commerce shop. There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.

> *A recent research has shown that an online e-commerce store having product wishlist functionality is likely to sell 30% more than the store which doesn't have wishlist functionality.* 

💰 *Not using a wishlist plugin yet? Let's start using it today. Addonify Wishlist is **FREE** & it will remain **FREE forever.***

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word.
